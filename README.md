# HADES
A Hexadecapolar Analysis for Dust Estimation in Simulations (for CMB B-mode polarisation maps).

This repository contains the Python analysis code used in Philcox, Sherwin & van Engelen (2018, in prep.) to detect and remove dust from B-mode thermal dust simulations. A tutorial will be available online shortly.

Our code primarily utilises the `flipper` and `flipperPol` packages as well as `HEALPix` and `PolSPICE`, amongst others.

The authors are happy to assist with any implementation of this code (contact Oliver Philcox: ohep2@cam.ac.uk)
